Alert 2022
In 2021, Afghanistan
continued to be the
armed conﬂict with
the highest death
toll in the world
(40,000), followed by
Yemen (22,000) and
Syria (between 3,800
and 5,700)
Graph 1.3. Percentage of high intensity armed conﬂicts
in the last decade
Graph 1.2. Intensity of the armed conﬂicts in 2021
Graph 1.4. Intensity of the armed conﬂicts by region
In line with what was observed in 2020, the largest
proportion of high-intensity con!icts in 2021 took
place in Africa. The continent registered
12 of the 17 high-intensity armed con!icts
identiﬁed around the world, or 71% of all
cases. Twelve of Africa’s 15 armed con!icts
(80%) were of high intensity, a percentage
much higher than that observed in recent
years (in 2019, only 44% of Africa’s armed
con!icts were of high intensity). After
Africa, the region with the second-highest
number of high-intensity cases was the
Middle East, with a total of three (9% of
the total con!icts worldwide, but 60% of
the con!icts in the region). In Asia, two high-intensity
armed con!icts were identiﬁed, while in the Americas
and Europe, no cases of this type were reported,
although levels of militarised tension increased, hand
in hand with the massive deployment of Russian troops
near the Ukrainian border and warnings of a possible
invasion. The 17 cases of serious armed con!ict in 2021
were: Cameroon (Ambazonia/Northwest and Southwest),
Ethiopia (Tigray), Mali, Mozambique (north), the Lake
Chad Region (Boko Haram), the Western Sahel Region,
the CAR, the DRC (east), the DRC (east-ADF), Somalia,
Sudan (Darfur), South Sudan, Afghanistan, Myanmar,
Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
In many of the high-intensity armed con!icts, the
hostilities and multiple dynamics of violence claimed
well over 1,000 lives per year. In Afghanistan alone,
which had the highest death toll in 2021, over 40,000
people lost their lives due to the armed con!ict. The
Afghan con!ict was also the deadliest in 2020, though
with less than 20,000 fatalities, and in 2019, when the
body count also exceeded 40,000. In 2021, the second-
bloodiest armed con!ict was in Yemen, where more than
22,000 people died. Since 2020, the war in Yemen has
been deadlier than the war in Syria, which for years had
been the bloodiest in the region. In 2021, the armed
con!ict in Syria continued to far exceed the threshold of
1,000 fatalities per year and various estimates indicate
that between 3,800 and 5,700 people may have died
due to the ﬁghting. These ﬁgures are signiﬁcantly lower
than those reported in previous years, however, when
the hostilities produced much higher estimated death
tolls (30,000 in 2018; more than 50,000 in 2016 and
2015, respectively; over 70,000 in 2014). Other armed
con!icts that stood out for their deadliness in 2021
were in the Western Sahel Region, where around 5,000
people were estimated to have been killed that year;
the DRC (east), with more than 4,800 people killed
by violence; Somalia, over than 3,000; and the Lake
Chad Region (Boko Haram), with between 1,800 and
3,800 fatalities, according to various accounts. In other
contexts, no yearly statistics were provided, but reports
also indicated thousands of deaths in 2021, as in the
case of Ethiopia (Tigray).
In 2021, armed con!icts were generally not as in!uenced
by COVID-19 as in 2020. In the second year of the

In Myanmar, the security forces intensiﬁed
their repression of the civilian population
after the military coup. Armed groups
continued to attack civilians as a tool to
spread terror, such as the ISIS-K attacks
on Shia mosques in Afghanistan and the
killing of civilians by the ISIS branch in
Sinai in Egypt, while armed state actors
were also singled out for abuse against the
civilian population. In Egypt (Sinai), for
example, the Egyptian Armed Forces were

[CHART DESCRIPTION: This image contains two charts, Graph 1.2 and Graph 1.3, which provide data on the intensity of armed conflicts in 2021, with a focus on the regions of Africa, Asia, and Europe. The accompanying text provides context for these charts.

### Graph 1.2: Intensity of the Armed Conflicts in 2021

This pie chart illustrates the distribution of the intensity of armed conflicts in 2021, categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High.

- **High Intensity**: This category accounts for 53% of the total conflicts. The largest proportion of high-intensity conflicts was in Africa, with 12 of the 17 high-intensity armed conflicts identified in the region. The text notes that 71% of all identified conflicts in Africa were of high intensity, with 80% of the 15 armed conflicts in the region being of this type. The text also states that the number of high-intensity conflicts in Africa was the second-highest globally, with a total of 39% of the world's total conflicts being of this type.
- **Medium Intensity**: This category represents 19% of the total conflicts. The text indicates that 12 of the 17 high-intensity armed conflicts were in Africa, and the remaining 5 were in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.
- **Low Intensity**: This category accounts for 28% of the total conflicts. The text notes that 12 of the 17 high-intensity armed conflicts were in Africa, and the remaining 5 were in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.

### Graph 1.3: Percentage of High Intensity Armed Conflicts in the Last Decade

[OCR from chart region: In line with what was observed in 2020, the largest
proportion of high-intensity conflicts in 2021 took
place in Africa. The continent registered
12 of the 17 high-intensity armed conflicts
identified around the world, or 71% of all
cases. Twelve of Africa’s 15 armed conflicts
(80%) were of high intensity, a percentage
much higher than that observed in recent
years (in 2019, only 44% of Africa’s armed
conflicts were of high intensity). After
Africa, the region with the second-highest
number of high-intensity cases was the
Middle East, with a total of three (9% of
the total conflicts worldwide, but 60% of
the conflicts in the region). In Asia, two high-intensity
armed conflicts were identified, while in the Americas
and Europe, no cases of this type were reported,
although levels of militarised tension increased, hand
in hand with the massive deployment of Russian troops
near the Ukrainian border and warnings of a possible

Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

In many of the high-intensity armed conflicts, the
hostilities and multiple dynamics of violence claimed
well over 1,000 lives per year. In Afghanistan alone,
which had the highest death toll in 2021, over 40,000
people lost their lives due to the armed conflict. The
Afghan conflict was also the deadliest in 2020, though
with less than 20,000 fatalities, and in 2019, when the
body count also exceeded 40,000. In 2021, the second-
bloodiest armed conflict was in Yemen, where more than
22,000 people died. Since 2020, the war in Yemen has
been deadlier than the war in Syria, which for years had
been the bloodiest in the region. In 2021, the armed
conflict in Syria continued to far exceed the threshold of
1,000 fatalities per year and various estimates indicate
that between 3,800 and 5,700 people may have died
due to the fighting. These figures are significantly lower
than those reported in previous years, however, when
the hostilities produced much higher estimated death
tolls (30,000 in 2018; more than 50,000 in 2016 and
2015, respectively; over 70,000 in 2014). Other armed
conflicts that stood out for their deadliness in 2021
were in the Western Sahel Region, where around 5,000
people were estimated to have been killed that year;
the DRC (east), with more than 4,800 people killed
by violence; Somalia, over than 3,000; and the Lake
Chad Region (Boko Haram), with between 1,800 and
3,800 fatalities, according to various accounts. In other
contexts, no yearly statistics were provided, but reports
also indicated thousands of deaths in 2021, as in the
case of Ethiopia (Tigray).

In 2021, armed conflicts were generally not as influenced
by COVID-19 as in 2020. In the second year of the

[CHART DESCRIPTION: This line chart displays the percentage of high-intensity armed conflicts over a 10-year period, from 2011 to 2021. The data is presented as a line graph with the percentage on the vertical axis and the year on the horizontal axis.

### Data Points and Trends

- **2011:** The percentage of high-intensity armed conflicts was approximately 24%.
- **2012:** It decreased slightly to about 23%.
- **2013:** The percentage rose to around 27%.
- **2014:** It increased further to about 32%.
- **2015:** The percentage rose to approximately 30%.
- **2016:** It reached a peak of about 40%.
- **2017:** The percentage remained stable at about 40%.
- **2018:** There was a sharp decline, dropping to about 27%.
- **2019:** The percentage increased to about 31%.
- **2020:** It rose to about 45%.
- **2021:** The percentage reached its highest point on the chart, at approximately 52%.

### Key Insights

- **Overall Trend:** The chart shows a general upward trend in the percentage of high-intensity armed conflicts from 2011 to 2021, with a notable dip in 2018.
- **Peak and Decline:** The highest point occurred in 2021, indicating a significant increase in the proportion of high-intensity conflicts compared to the yearly total.
- **Stability and Fluctuation:** The period from 2016 to 2017 was marked by stability, with the percentage remaining at 40%. The 2018 decline was a significant event, followed by a recovery in 2019 and a further increase in 2020 and 2021.
- **Interpretation:** The data suggests that the proportion of high-intensity armed conflicts has been increasing over time, with a notable increase in the most recent years. The 2018 drop may reflect a period of reduced conflict, while the subsequent rise indicates a resurgence in conflict activity.

### Labels and Notes

- **Vertical Axis (Y-axis):** Ranges from 0 to 60, with major gridlines at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60.
- **Horizontal Axis (X-axis):** Represents the years from 2011 to 2021.
- **Legend:** The chart is labeled with a note at the bottom: "* Percentage of high-intensity armed conflicts compared to the yearly total." This indicates that the values are relative to the total number of armed conflicts in a given year, not absolute numbers.

In summary, the chart illustrates a complex pattern of change in the proportion of high-intensity armed conflicts over the decade, with a clear upward trend and a significant dip in 2018.]
